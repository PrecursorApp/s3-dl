# s3-dl
Simple script to download files from an s3 bucket.

We mainly use this script to download jars from s3 when we deploy new code. We needed something with minimal dependencies--most other scripts depend on perl or python. This script only needs a base FreeBSD install.

Offers very little in the way of configuration. It's short enough that you can fork and edit your own copy.
